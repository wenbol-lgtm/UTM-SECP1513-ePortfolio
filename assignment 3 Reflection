# Reflection: Industry Visit (3.pdf)

## What I Learned
This industry visit showed me how tech systems are actually used in a real workplace (e.g., the company’s daily use of information management tools). I also saw how different teams (like IT and operations) collaborate to keep systems running.

## Improvements for Next Time
I’ll take more photos of the on-site setups (with permission) to make my report more visual. I’ll also talk to more staff members to get diverse perspectives.

## Additional Notes
Visiting the actual workplace made me realize how the course content applies to real-world jobs.
