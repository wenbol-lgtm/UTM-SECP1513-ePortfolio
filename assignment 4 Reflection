# Reflection: Industry Visit to Johor Port Berhad (4.pdf)

## What I Learned
This visit let me understand how ICT systems support port logistics. I learned about key tools like JPBi portal (real-time coordination), ERP RAMCO (unified resource management), and data-driven tools (Power BI/Python for efficiency). I also grasped the importance of stable infrastructure, such as MetroCluster solutions and dual-ISP redundancy, for non-stop port operations.

## Improvements for Next Time
I’ll take more specific notes on how the ICT team uses low-code platforms (e.g., Bee Bug System) in daily work. I’ll also ask about common system troubleshooting cases to link theory to practice.

## Additional Notes
This visit showed me that ICT isn’t just an industrial tool—it connects port efficiency to daily life (e.g., faster fresh produce delivery). It helped me see the practical value of system integration and reliability we learn in class.
