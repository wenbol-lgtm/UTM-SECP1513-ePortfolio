# Reflection: Design Thinking Project - Building Maintenance Management System (BMMS)

## What I Learned
Through this project, I understood the core functions of a Building Maintenance Management System (BMMS), such as equipment management, work order tracking, and real-time monitoring. I also mastered how to create a low-fidelity prototype that focuses on user flow and core functionality, rather than polished visuals, to quickly test design concepts. Additionally, I learned to prioritize user needs in the design process, ensuring the system solves practical maintenance pain points.

## Improvements for Next Time
I will refine the prototype with more detailed user interaction logic (e.g., how to assign work orders efficiently). I will also gather feedback from potential users (like maintenance staff) earlier to adjust the system’s functionality before finalizing the design.

## Additional Notes
This design thinking project taught me how to turn a real-world problem into a practical software solution. It highlighted the importance of balancing functionality and usability, which will guide my approach to future design or development tasks.
