# Reflection: PC Assemble Lab (PC LAB.png)

## What I Learned
This PC assembly lab let me grasp the practical steps of putting together core hardware (like motherboard, CPU, RAM, and hard drive). I also figured out how to check if components are properly connected (e.g., making sure the power cable is tightly plugged in), which is a basic but key skill for hardware setup.

## Improvements for Next Time
I’ll organize the components before starting next time to avoid mixing up parts. I’ll also take notes while assembling, so I can recall the steps more clearly when documenting later.

## Additional Notes
This hands-on lab helped me turn the course’s hardware theory into real skills—now I know how the internal parts of a computer work together.
